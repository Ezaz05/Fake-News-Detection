       "'kamala harris announces u s  senate bid los angeles  cnn  hours after california attorney general kamala harris began raising money for a bid to replace barbara boxer in the u s  senate  billionaire environmentalist tom steyer outlined the case for his own run tuesday and said he would decide soon    setting up the likelihood of an exorbitantly expensive contest that could have two democrats facing off in november of        california s two senate seats have been locked down by boxer and u s  sen  dianne feinstein since       closing off statewide opportunities for the next generation of politicians   under california s new top two primary system  the top two candidates in the first round will advance to the general election  regardless of their party   in a column on the huffington post website  steyer said he was intrigued by the opportunity of taking on interests in washington that  oppose recognizing global warming and fight against the rights and futures of average americans     washington needs to be shaken up and we need climate champions who will fight for the next generation   steyer said   california democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent  and i will decide soon based on what i think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve american prosperity    steyer and harris would be among the most formidable contenders for boxer s seat  along with former los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa  who has said he is  seriously considering  a run  several members of the california congressional delegation and of the state leadership have signaled interest  including rep  loretta sanchez  rep  john garamendi  and state treasurer john chiang   in a facebook post on tuesday  sanchez touted her focus on working families  immigration reform and affordable healthcare    i have advocated for policies that give all families the same access to the american dream   she said   californians deserve a strong voice in washington and i have never been afraid to speak up  which is why i am seriously considering running for the united states senate in         but lesser known candidates could face great difficulty raising the money needed to run  boxer raised some     million in conjunction with party committees for her      race against former hewlett packard chief executive carly fiorina   steyer  a former hedge fund manager from san francisco whose net worth has been estimated at      billion by forbes  has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to public interest and philanthropic causes during his lifetime  he has been a vocal opponent of the keystone xl pipeline and a free spending advocate for california environmental causes   his nextgen climate action committee spent more than     million in the midterm elections    much of it steyer s money    trying to defeat candidates who had expressed doubt about climate change  but they had little demonstrable success in a republican wave year   while villaraigosa could build a strong southern california base  and draw on his support from california s growing latino community  harris also has a solid fundraising base in california from her two statewide runs and her close alliance with president barack obama   she has won praise as attorney general for pursuing banks that did not follow proper procedures when they foreclosed on the properties of california homeowners and she has kept a steady focus on reducing recidivism and truancy    i will be a fighter for the next generation on the critical issues facing our country  i will be a fighter for middle class families who are feeling the pinch of stagnant wages and diminishing opportunity   she continued   i will be a fighter for our children who deserve a world class education  and for students burdened by predatory lenders and skyrocketing tuition  and i will fight relentlessly to protect our coast  our immigrant communities and our seniors    newsom has told many confidantes that he is interested in running for governor when jerry brown faces term limits in       and he and harris share the same political consultants  in a statement on his facebook page  newsom said it was better  to be candid than be coy  and noted that it would be better for his three children  montana  hunter and brooklynn  if he stayed in california    while i am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office  i know that my head and my heart  my young family s future and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the state of california    not washington  d c  therefore i will not seek election to the u s  senate in        newsom said   hinting at his potential alliance with harris  he added that in the months to come  he looked  forward to doing whatever i can to help elect california s next great democratic senator    one worthy of succeeding barbara boxer and serving this remarkable state of dreamers and doers in the united states senate    shortly after boxer announced that she would retire from the senate in       los angeles mayor eric garcetti said he would not run for the seat  real'"
